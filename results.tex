\subsection{Experimental Results}
In the following paragraphs, we report the results of our experiments.

\subsubsection{RQ1. Mono-objective SBSE Validation}
\paragraph{Method}
In this experiment, we generate a set of random Csmith programs \textit{"the training set"} and apply different mono-objective algorithms to evaluate the non-functional properties of produced binaries. We compare as well manually generated sequences to standard GCC optimization levels. Our quality metric in this experiment is the percentage of overall performance improvement across all programs under test compared to a non-optimized version. The goal of this initial experiment is to: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of our component-based infrastructure to extract non-functional properties such as memory and CPU consumptions; (2) evaluate the performance of our proposed diversity-based exploration of optimization sequences (NS) to GA and RS; and finally (3) find the optimal solution relative to the input training set.
\paragraph{Results}
The goal of thus experiement is to

\subsubsection{RQ2. Sensitivity}
\paragraph{Method}
Another interesting experiment is to test the sensitivity of training set programs to best optimal sequence previously discovered in RQ1. To do so, we apply best discovered optimizations to new unseen Csmith and CBench programs and compared the performance results. The idea of this experiment is to test whether only Csmith programs are more sensitive to compiler optimizations or not. If so, this will be useful for compiler users and researchers to use NOTICE in order to build general optimization sequences from their representative training set programs.
\paragraph{Results}
\subsubsection{RQ3. Impact of optimizations on resource consumption}
\paragraph{Method}
To answer this question, we use NOTICE to generate best sequences per-Benchmark in term of speedup, and compare the memory footprint and CPU consumption of best optimized code. The goal of this experiment is to provide an understanding of the resource consumption of generated code by GCC.

\subsubsection{RQ4. Trade-offs between non-functional properties}
\paragraph{Method}
A multi-objective approach provides a trade-off between two objectives where the developers can select their desired solution from the Pareto-optimal front. The goal of this experiment is to put more emphasis on resource consumption and use multi-objective algorithms to find trade-offs between non-functional properties of generated code like $<$ExecutionTime--MemoryUsage$>$, etc.
\paragraph{Results}
In this section, we compare our NS adaptation for optimizations generation to the current, state-of-the-art multi-objective approaches namely NSGA-II and RS. Two tradeoffs are investigated in this section; $<$execution time--memory usage$>$ and $<$execution time--CPU usage$>$.

First, we conduct a quantitative study by comparing the HV metric for both tradeoffs than we conduct a quantitative study through pareto front distribution charts.
